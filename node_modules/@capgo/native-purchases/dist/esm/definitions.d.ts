     * - Fraud detection: Helps platforms detect irregular activity (e.g., many devices purchasing on the same account)
     * - User linking: Links purchases to in-game characters, avatars, or in-app profiles
     *
     * PLATFORM DIFFERENCES:
     * - iOS: Must be a valid UUID format (e.g., "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")
     *        Apple's StoreKit 2 requires UUID format for the appAccountToken parameter
     * - Android: Can be any obfuscated string (max 64 chars), maps to Google Play's ObfuscatedAccountId
     *           Google recommends using encryption or one-way hash
     *
     * SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (especially for Android):
     * - DO NOT store Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like emails in cleartext
     * - Use encryption or a one-way hash to generate an obfuscated identifier
     * - Maximum length: 64 characters (both platforms)
     * - Storing PII in cleartext will result in purchases being blocked by Google Play
     *
     * IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE:
     * ```typescript
     * // For iOS: Generate a deterministic UUID from user ID
     * import { v5 as uuidv5 } from 'uuid';
     * const NAMESPACE = '6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8'; // Your app's namespace UUID

     * });

     *
     * **2. Server-side (Android only, recommended for security)**: Use Google Play Developer API v3
     * - Endpoint: `POST https://androidpublisher.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v3/applications/{packageName}/purchases/products/{productId}/tokens/{token}:acknowledge`
     * - Requires OAuth 2.0 authentication with appropriate scopes
     * - See: https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/rest/v3/purchases.products/acknowledge
     * - For subscriptions: Use `/purchases/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/tokens/{token}:acknowledge` instead
     * - Note: iOS has no server-side finish API
     *
     * **When to use manual acknowledgment:**
     * - Server-side validation: Verify the purchase with your backend before acknowledging
     * - Entitlement delivery: Ensure user receives content/features before acknowledging
     * - Multi-step workflows: Complete all steps before final acknowledgment
     * - Security: Prevent client-side manipulation by handling acknowledgment server-side (Android only)
     *
     * @param options - The purchase to acknowledge
     * @param options.purchaseToken - The purchase token (Android) or transaction ID as string (iOS) from the Transaction object
     * @returns {Promise<void>} Promise that resolves when the purchase is acknowledged/finished
     * @throws An error if acknowledgment/finishing fails or transaction not found
     * @platform android Acknowledges the purchase with Google Play
     * @platform ios Finishes the transaction with StoreKit 2
